# 2Checkout Live Mode Verification

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

Your 2Checkout integration has been switched from **TEST MODE** to **LIVE MODE**.

### Updated Settings:
```env
TWOCHECKOUT_SANDBOX=false  # Changed from true to false
```

### Configuration Status:
- **Environment**: Production (Live)
- **Payment Processing**: Real transactions will be processed
- **Test Cards**: No longer accepted
- **Real Cards**: Will be charged actual amounts

## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Check Configuration
Run this command to verify the setting is applied:
```bash
php artisan tinker
config('services.twocheckout.sandbox')
# Should return: false
```

### 2. Test Payment Process
1. **Create a test order** with a small amount (e.g., $1.00)
2. **Use a real credit card** (not test cards)
3. **Verify the payment** appears in your 2Checkout dashboard under "Sales"

### 3. Monitor Dashboard
- **2Checkout Dashboard**: Check for real transactions
- **Laravel Logs**: Monitor for any payment errors
- **Application Logs**: Verify order completion workflow

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Production Notes

### 1. SSL Certificate Required
- **HTTPS must be enabled** on your production domain
- 2Checkout requires SSL for live transactions
- Verify SSL certificate is properly installed

### 2. Webhook Configuration
Update your 2Checkout webhook URL to production domain:
```
Production Webhook URL: https://yourdomain.com/webhook/2checkout
```

### 3. PCI Compliance
- Your application uses 2Checkout's hosted payment fields
- Card data never touches your servers
- You remain PCI compliant with this integration

## üß™ Test Cards (NO LONGER WORK)

These test cards will **NOT work** in live mode:
- ‚ùå 4000000000000002 (Visa)
- ‚ùå 5555555555554444 (Mastercard)
- ‚ùå 378282246310005 (American Express)

## üí≥ Live Mode Considerations

### 1. Real Money Transactions
- **All payments will be processed for real**
- **Refunds must be processed through 2Checkout dashboard**
- **Failed payments will not create orders**

### 2. Payment Methods
These real payment methods are now accepted:
- ‚úÖ Visa, Mastercard, American Express
- ‚úÖ Discover, JCB, Diners Club
- ‚úÖ PayPal (if enabled in 2Checkout)
- ‚úÖ Local payment methods (based on region)

### 3. Currency and Fees
- **USD currency** as configured
- **2Checkout processing fees** will apply
- **Transaction fees** deducted from settlements

## üîß Troubleshooting Live Mode

### Common Issues:

#### 1. SSL/HTTPS Errors
```
Error: "Payment gateway requires HTTPS"
Solution: Ensure SSL certificate is installed and working
```

#### 2. Webhook Failures
```
Error: "Webhook URL not reachable"
Solution: Update webhook URL in 2Checkout dashboard
```

#### 3. Authorization Errors
```
Error: "Invalid merchant credentials"
Solution: Verify live API keys are correctly configured
```

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check current configuration
php artisan config:show services.twocheckout

# Clear all caches
php artisan optimize:clear

# Check environment variables
php artisan env
```

## üìä Monitoring Live Payments

### 1. 2Checkout Dashboard
- **Sales Reports**: Track successful transactions
- **Failed Payments**: Monitor declined cards/errors
- **Settlement Reports**: Track when funds are deposited

### 2. Laravel Application
- **Order Management**: Verify orders are created correctly
- **Email Notifications**: Confirm payment confirmations are sent
- **User Dashboard**: Check payment history displays correctly

### 3. Server Logs
Monitor these log files for payment-related issues:
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log  # If using Nginx
```
